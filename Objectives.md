# Course objectives

Uber-Objective is to get moving under your own steam. To give you a birds-eye view of the world of iOS-dev so that you can direct your dive-in.

Over the next fortnight we will learn:

- how to create a remote WebServer at digitalocean.com (Unbuntu Linux running a LAMP stack) from which we will host our own website. 

- to become familiar with the BASH commandline both on our local MacOS machine and our remote Linux machine. 

- to administer our remote Linux machine through `ssh` and transfer files between local and remote machines through `sftp`

- the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the holy trinity of web development), creating our own webpage(s) locally, inspecting content using a web browser, then uploading to our server.

- how to program using the Swift language.

- what code compilation is (compiling `helloWorld.c`)

- to develop iOS Applications using the XCode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) & IB (Interface Builder)

- how to debug; breakpoints, call-stack, single-step

- how to run our code on an iPhone

- how to use available resources: Apple's documentation, Stack Overflow, IRC, Apple Dev site: doc, ibooks, forums, [blogs](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-blogs-about-Apple-Swift) / ...

- how to use GitHub / Gitter to collaborate
