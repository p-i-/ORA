## RESOURCES: iOS AppDev with SWIFT

Building Your First Swift App Video (6min) https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=16

https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/  
This is the material my PowerPoint slides cover.
Notice it is bizarrely hidden.  It is a 'hello world' of iOS appdev, but try finding it from the main page.
  In fact try finding it from the parent 'Guides and Sample Code' page. It is absolutely buried!

Skimming these guides:
 * iPhoneOSTechOverview - Look at the bottom of the intro page & see guides for Human Interface guidelines & App distribution
 * VideoSnake
 * SpeakToMe: Using Speech Recognition with AVAudioEngine
 * SpeedSketch: Leveraging touch input for a drawing application
 * Photo Capture Programming Guide
 * iAd Programming Guide
 * iOS Technology Overview <-- notice this is just the same as iPhoneOSTechOverview i.e. This whole thing is a mess
 * Teslameter <-- NICE but Obj-C
 * **MyLife: A simple app for starting iOS development**
 
_(Remember to set project settings -> build settings -> development team)_
