## Assignments
Today we looked through the weekend assignments.

## Hello WEB
Then we used `ssh` to Secure-Shell into our droplets (running Ubuntu Linux) and create our first webpage.

TODO: !!!

## Timer
In the afternoon I set a challenge: to build a countdown timer!  Notice in `TimerBits/` the way I test out each component individually in a separate project, before putting everything together in `Timer/`.  This 'divide and conquer' strategy becomes essential in more complicated projects. It's really good practice!


## A few tutorials I considered for the afternoon that we don't actually do in the end:
