Today we glanced through Apple's stock Hello World tutorial:  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

Notice at the end of each lesson you can download the code.

Just as an illustration I looked through the "Implement Navigation" chapter and put together a simple app that demonstrates Segues: A root view controller that navigates to a child view controller (which can then be closed to return to the root).

The main point I am illustrating here is that the Apple documentation is really good nowadays. Use it! And experiment with fresh projects constantly. That's the only way you can get comfortable, by doing!
