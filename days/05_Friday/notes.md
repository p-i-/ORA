# Primes
We create (using Xcode / Swift) a MacOS commandline app that calculates if a number is prime or not.

* Build
* Click on Products -> primes
* Observe the full path in the file inspector
* find and run the file using `terminal`

This illustrates that Xcode can build code for MacOS as well as iOS.


# Breakpoints
Set a break point and single-step through the above code.


# Torch
This is the first app we build and run on our actual iPhone.


# RGB
Another simple iOS app to run on the device.
