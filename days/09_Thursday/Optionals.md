The Calc project demonstrates ***optionals*** in Swift.

An optional is a variable that could be `nil`.

So:

    var s : String?
    
... defines s as an optional `String`.

A ***textbox*** has a `.value` which is a `String?`, which makes sense: the text box could be empty!

This project demonstrates optionals very nicely!
