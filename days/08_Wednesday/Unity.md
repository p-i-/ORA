Unity3D -- multiplatform technology for building games.

Google 'roll-a-ball tutorial' -- it is Unity's 'hello world' tutorial and it is brilliant!

Make use of the `#unity3d` IRC channel!

Unity uses ***C#*** which isn't quite as nice as Swift. It feels a bit clumsy after using Swift. But it's still pretty decent!
